agile/scrum

scrum/standup meeting. each person quickly says
    what are you up to
    what have you been up to
    is anything stopping you from doing what you want to do

sprint. allocate set time for set amount of work to be done.
    more often than not you do not meet the amount.
    most companies 3-4 weeks. past 6 weeks is bad idea in practice.

standup/sprint review
    did we accomplish what set out to do in sprint
