and remember it may be easier to get a hardcoded order placed first, one that doesn't rely on user input. maybe something like this progression:
1. an action method which, if any request hits it, it will place a hardcoded order containing one product, without any input data needed. (use the /swagger page, for example, to test it out, no need to use fetch yet)
2. update that action method to place the order with two products in it.
3. write html/css/js so that you can place that hardcoded order by clicking a button.
4. make the customer & store customizable from user input and sent to the action method by fetch.
5. make the product quantities customizable
6. make which products are included at all customizable (full functionality)
