on-premises deployment
    IT bottleneck, moves code from repo
    to dev server, test server, staging server, production server
    overhead in IT as well, diminishing returns on adding more people
    dev deployment takes too long and thus happens on lots of changes at once so debugging is harder

deploy to testing, staging, production, etc
    can be manual approval or automated based on conditions
    can be batch processed on time intervals like every hour

development and operations team working together to agree on the pipeline
for automated building and deploying of code to a server

CI (continuous integration) - code to server
    build process (automated)
        build, analyze, test, notify, deploy to dev server
        based on scripts that IT manages
    includes packaging

people process product
    people of "development + operations"
        dev
        plus IT, QA governance, stakeholders/client

IT -> devops engineering team

CD (continuous deployment)
    beyond CI, automate from dev to test server -
        code goes back to build process for packaging process, then to test server
            packaging process includes package repo separate from code repo
                contains binaries not source
    CDe (continuous delivery)
        sometimes differentiated from deployment
        meaning, deploy to final production server

EDIT:
ok we reviewed this topic & talked it over, i thought i was giving you guys the most common definition, instead i had given you a rarer definition.
here is the "real answer" (although, just like "polymorphism," not everyone agrees on that real answer, and wherever you work may have a different definition):
continuous deployment means we have an automatic deployment all the way to production, with no manual approval required (if all our tests pass).
continuous delivery still takes us to production, but it has some amount of manual approval, manual trigger (again, if all our tests pass).
https://www.gocd.org/2018/01/17/continuous-delivery-beginners-guide/

move testing, staging, production servers to cloud (probably not dev)
    AWS, Azure, Google Cloud (more commercial)
    IBM, Red Hat, VMWare (more enterprise)
    government versions of all these, stays in country borders
    only pay for what you use. not paying for on-premises server when don't need one

IAAS - infrastructure as a service
    from cloud you get just a server that you can change OS or anything on
PAAS - platform AAS
    from cloud you get IAAS with runtimes/software but still access to server too,
    except can't change OS
SAAS - software AAS
    from cloud you get PAAS with software, probably limited to exactly the one thing
    like Azure SQL, you don't access server underneath
FAAS (new) - function AAS
    just a method

hybrid cloud
    connect on-premises infrastructure to cloud infrastructure
    maybe for security
multi cloud
    use more than one cloud provider for redundancy
    if one provider is down, able to switch to another to limit downtime

SLA service level agreement
    cloud provider guarantees some amount of uptime. less than 100%. 99.95% at best.
        late 2017 SLA up to 99.99% for some services (sql, vm). 50 minutes in a year

for what we will use
    AWS
        EC2 (VM) - our build server - EBS (drive)
            "EC2" - elastic compute cloud
                onboard drive - lives as long as VM lives
                    instance storage
                three on team
                    one will run Jenkins (windows)
                    one will run the app (windows)
                    one will run SonarQube (windows)
            "EBS" - elastic block store
                block storage
            Jenkins build server
                Groovyscript - manage: import analyze build package deploy
                MsBuild & Nuget
                    except maybe not MsBuild, maybe really dotnet cli
                SonarQube - static analysis
                MSDeploy - package & deploy
                Slack - notification
                alternatives to Jenkins -
                    TravisCI
                    CircleCI
                    for .NET:
                        TFS: on-premises
                            more legacy or for secretive stuff
                        VSTS: online/cloud
                            way for the future™
                    GitLab/CIRunners
                    Bamboo (by Atlassian)
                    TeamCD (by JetBrains)
                    GoCD
                        built from ground up for CD
                        others were built for CI and extended to CD
        S3 - drive storage
            "S3" simple storage service
            storage for webapp like images
        (also has "RDS" for DB like Azure DB. not as nice as Azure DB)
    Azure
        App Service - our webapp
        Azure DB - our sql server

drive storage -
    like a folder on local machine
    like dropbox, google drive, onedrive, box
    can access through webapp
block/disk storage - Azure Disk, Azure Managed Disk (new)
    like hard drive on local machine
    must access through OS
    attached to one machine at a time
file storage
    for big files or something
    shared across many machines

Azure SQL Database
    scale without downtime
    automatic backups, geo-replication, failure detection
    security, monitoring
Azure Cosmos DB
Azure Cache for Redis
    good as a distributed cache (server-side caching)
    concurrent DB connections are a bottleneck, so adding a cache alongside a SQL DB
    makes a lot of sense if queried data is not changing all the time.
Azure VM
Azure App Service
    deployment slots
    autoscaling, load balancing
    WebJobs - background tasks to run in an app service
Azure Application Insights (monitoring)
Azure Service Fabric (container orchestrator for microservices)
Azure Kubernetes Service (container orchestrator for microservices)
Azure Functions (serverless; code triggered by http request or some event in azure)
    comparable to AWS Lambda
Azure CDN - global cache of static content, e.g. html, js, images
    customers get files from closest location to them. browser-oriented caching.
    https://<endpointname>.azureedge.net
Azure Key Vault - store keys, secrets, connection strings, etc. securely without
    having to redeploy the app to modify them, and without storing them in code.
    method to get secret at runtime: KeyVaultClient.GetSecretAsync
    https://<YOUR_VAULT_NAME>.vault.azure.net
Azure Active Directory - identity service provider. verify identity of users and
    apps within an organization (a directory)

Azure Stack - for hybrid cloud. provide azure services from on-premises hardware.

Azure Resource Manager templates

Azure Storage
    azure managed disk - like disk you attach to one machine at a time
    azure files - like disk you attach to many machines (file share)
        good for hybrid cloud scenarios
    azure blob - object store. doesn't have a filesystem
        inside the storage accuont, "containers"; inside container, blobs.
        http://<storageaccountname>.blob.core.windows.net/<containername>/<blobname>
        store images for webapps to fetch, log files
        stream audio, video
        best option for very large files
        aws version is called S3
    Azure Queues - store messages in queues
    Azure Tables - NoSQL schema-less data storage
    for most storage resources, besides managed disks, you need a
        storage account to hold them.

Azure Service Bus - like Azure Queues, but with some differences,
    some more advanced features. supports AMQP, transactions.

a big advantage of cloud computing is the ease of scaling and the ability to pay only for what resources you use when you use them.
scaling is something we have to think about regardless of cloud or on-premises.
in terms of scaling we have two terms: _scale out_ and _scale up_.
scale up (vertical) means, the resources we have (VM, disk, db, etc), we want them bigger. upgrade with more memory, faster throughput.
scale out (horizontal) means: we want more copies of the same resources we currently have.
each has different advantages - scale up has less overhead in general, but has practical limits, and usually requires some downtime.
scale out improves availability (if one server crashes), no downtime, but could raise issues with session data.
both are far easier in cloud than with on-premises servers, especially scaling out, which it is possible to automate.
there are buttons on most azure resources for Scale out and Scale up.


Flow
    Github Flow
        CI on master branch, feature branches are on their own

How do we deploy our application?
