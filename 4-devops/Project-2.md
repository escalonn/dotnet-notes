            - Reliability/Security/Maintainability at least B
    - (optional: release definitions with deploy instead of in build, and with health checks)
- must have some calls to an external API, or integration with some other service
- authentication and authorization with Auth0
- Project board to track user stories across team
- Docker (working Dockerfiles for service and for web app)
- any other tech you want within reason
- the data model (how many tables, what kind of complex relationship like N to N) must be at least as complicated as project 1.
- the user interaction model (what are the user stories, what inputs/interactions can the user make) must be at least as complicated as project 1.
- a project proposal
    - MVP minimum viable product
    - potentially stretch goals, extra features
