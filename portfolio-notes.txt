about me - ~15 lines of fluff around actual technology in bold. first half stuff i want to do, 2nd half stuff i don't especially want to do, must be able to answer prompt on all of them.

rules several have missed:
- avoid Frivolous Capitalization of things That Don't Need It
- first sentence of about me should not only be about back-end - should say you are a "full stack" developer, or, mention some front-end thing as well as the C#/.NET.
- every bullet point needs a period at the end
- first bullet point in about me should reiterate the full tech stack
- every about me bullet point needs technologies and techniques bolded
- main technology of every week of training needs to appear in about me.
- there are rules for the "show globally" and "show on portfolio" checkboxes; follow them
