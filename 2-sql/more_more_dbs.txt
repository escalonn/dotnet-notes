transactions can have savepoints
    SAVE TRANSACTION <savepoint-name>
    ROLLBACK TRANSACTION <savepoint-name>
views can be created with option SCHEMABINDING
    this means that the table(s) underneath the view cannot be changed in a way that would break the view.
indexes, clustered and nonclustered
    default on primary key and unique
    often good idea to add on foreign keys
    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_name ON Movie.Movie ( GenreID )
scan: SQL Server iterates through many values looking for the right ones
seek: SQL Server is able to look up what it needs much faster (binary search) using an index
    think about when the indexes can actually be used.
    if your query has a WHERE IndexedCol = val, we can use it.
    if it has WHERE SOME_FUNCTION(IndexedCal) = val, we can't use it.

in some cases, a join-based query can be faster than a subquery-based query, namely when the subquery is doing some EXISTS check based on the values from the outer query. we should replace that with INNER JOIN.
