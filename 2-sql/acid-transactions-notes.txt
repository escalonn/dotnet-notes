ACID: properties of a transaction

A - atomic
    all or nothing. no partial effects.
C - consistent
    constraints of DB not violated.
I - isolated
    transactions can't interfere with one another.
    it should be as though they are all run sequentially.
    but we relax this principle!

    isolation levels, weakest to strongest:
        read_uncommitted
            allows dirty read
                can i read uncommited data?
                (from other ongoing transactions)
        read_committed
            allows nonrepeatable read
            can i read the same row twice and see different things?
            (from another transaction changing it in between)
            default for SQL Server
        repeatable
            allows phantoms
            can i run the same query twice and see extra rows the second time?
            (from another transaction adding a row)
        serializable
            blocks all those
            higher possibility of deadlocks depending on how the queries are written
D - durable
    effects should not only be in volatile memory,
    but persisted to non-volatile memory like hard drive.
