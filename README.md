# dotnet-notes

author Nick Escalona.

This repo contains my notes I reference for the .NET curriculum.
Some notes I instead keep in source code which is rewritten from batch to batch -
for example, notes on EF DB-first and code-first implementation live in code.
This code is accessible at my latest trainer-code repo - at the time of this
writing, [1909-sep30-net/trainer-code](https://github.com/1909-sep30-net/trainer-code/).
