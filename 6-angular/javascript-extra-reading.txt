http://javascript.info/document

skim pages 1 through 7 of the document section

http://javascript.info/events

skim this section briefly, enough to learn what stopPropagation and preventDefault do

http://javascript.info/async

skim promises section.

not expected to know all details, but should be able to give general description of feature and at least a couple details.

http://javascript.info/form-elements

this section is helpful if you are working with forms in your project 1.5 with javascript.

also:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cross-site-scripting?view=aspnetcore-2.2

skim this to learn what XSS is, and at least one technique or feature in ASP.NET to prevent it. similar concept to SQL injection.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/cors?view=aspnetcore-2.2

read the opening paragraph for understanding, and then use the suggestions to enable CORS on your API, _if_ you wish to make AJAX requests from the MVC website to the backend service. not necessary if HttpClient is the only thing accessing your API. (edited)
