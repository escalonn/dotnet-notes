put --no-incremental on the build step of our api and mvc

# event binding
<div #myDiv></div>
<img (click)="myFunction(data, myDiv)"></img>

some points to whiteboard:
    dependency injection - PokemonComponent needs PokemonService needs HttpClient
    jasmine spec - describe, it 'should work', expect(testSubject).toFulfillCondition
        testingmodule replaces the normal module for whatever we are testing,
        allows substituting different dependencies for test purposes, like RouterTestingModule

HttpClient
    promise
        .then, chaining
    observable
        .subscribe, reactive
