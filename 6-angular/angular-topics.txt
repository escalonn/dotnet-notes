Dependency injection
Templates
    ngModel
    Pipes
        e.g. date formatting
Routing?
@Injectable
    service
    HttpClient
        promise
            .then, chaining
        observable
            .subscribe, reactive
    dependency injection
testing with jasmine/karma
pipeline integration (probably without tests)

some points to whiteboard:
    dependency injection - PokemonComponent needs PokemonService needs HttpClient
    jasmine spec - describe, it 'should work', expect(testSubject).toFulfillCondition
        testingmodule replaces the normal module for whatever we are testing,
        allows substituting different dependencies for test purposes, like RouterTestingModule
