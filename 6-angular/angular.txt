    library, pure javascript                    framework, all typescript
    based on MVVm (model view viewmodel)        components
                                                    template (like view)

MV* pattern
    MVC model view controller
    MVVM model view viewmodel - controller logic taken over by routing and views/viewmodels
    MVP model view presenter. presenter based on app state, more "powerful" than controller.
        not really used, more heavy.

single page application

index.ts
    import { MainCom } "./MainCom.ts"
    mainCom.init

maincom.ts
    import { NgModule } 'angular/core'

    @NgModule ({
        imports
        xexports
        providers
    })

    export class MainCom implements NgInit (
        constructor()
        key: value
        methodname()
    )

othercom.ts
    import { }
    @Component({
        selector
        template
        style
    })
