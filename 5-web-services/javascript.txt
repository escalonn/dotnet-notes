javascript is interpreted
it is a compile target of many libraries and then
prototype-based
    object-oriented without classes
    instead of class as template for object,
        an object can be a prototype for more objects
dynamically typed. with 6 basic types
using ECMAScript 5, + some 6. latest JS is ES2019

functions are first-class, are just objects, like arrays

types: number, string, boolean, null, undefined, object, symbol (es6)
typeof
functions are objects, but typeof calls them "function" for convenience
null is null, but typeof calls it "object" and this is kept only for backwards compatibility
have arrays too (objects)
     array.ForEach

type conversion all over the place
regular equality ==, does type coercion
strict equality ===, is the good one that does not coerce types. if the type is different, it's not equal.

function declaration
function sayHi() {
  alert( "Hello" );
}
expression
let sayHi = function() {
  alert( "Hello" );
};
functions are values like delegates are in c#
arrow functions (es6)
method shorthand sayHi() { alert("Hello") } in object

constructors are just functions that set on "this" and are called with "new". can set methods too.

has classes with es6, but just syntax over prototypal inheritance. class extends too.

es5 strict mode:
turned some silent JS errors into thrown errors.
- assignments that fail throw errors
turns some sloppy practices into syntax errors.
- not allowed to assign to undeclared variable, must declare first

es6:
    const
    block scope (let)
    arrow functions
        this
    method syntax for function properties
    default parameters
    string interpolation `-- ${x} --`
    classes with constructors, inheritance
    symbol type
    various useful built-in functions like string searching
    Promises
    es6 modules (import, export)
    Set and Map data structures
    for of
    getters/setters
    internationalization features (number/date/currency format)
    spread, destructuring

falsy / truthy
    false / true
    +-0-or-NaN / 1-or-other-number
    null-and-undefined / {}-or-any-object
    empty-string / any-other-string

global/document scope, function/local scope

hoisting -
    declarations in a function are moved to the top of the function, not
    function statements

closure -
    reference something which is no longer in scope.
    define inner function referencing variable in outer function
    inner function keeps a reference to that variable, keeps it alive

JSON.stringify
JSON.parse

callbacks, callback functions
    a function with callbacks takes a second function as parameter
    the first function's result is passed to the second function
    and the first function returns the return value of that

immediately-invoked function expression
    write a function without storing it anywhere and invoke it right away.
    anonymous

html5 web storage api, storing string-string key-value pairs.
    functions setItem, getItem, removeItem, clear.
    localStorage - shared between tabs, lives forever
    sessionStorage - specific to tab, gone when tab is closed
