put your project 2 in an AKS cluster. each of you should have your own cluster, but you can work on it together in your p2 teams. follow this tutorial - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app - and once you get it working with their sample app, figure out how to do the same with your p2.

some points about azure costs in that tutorial. i suggest you delete everything before the end of the day, and it'd cost like $1 tops. or you can avoid charges but things might be slow.
(1) it has you create an ACR resource (azure container registry). this is like a private docker hub. (a private docker registry, in other words). it costs about $0.10/day i think. if you want, you can skip this and take the image from docker hub. in that case you can ignore the parts of authenticating with the ACR later on.
(2) it has you create a cluster with the default VM size of DS1, which costs about $0.10/hour each. if you want, you can add the line --node-vm-size Standard_B1s to the az aks create command, which will make it instead use the VM size you get for free. (again it might be painfully slow though.)
