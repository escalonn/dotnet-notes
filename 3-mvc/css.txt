- Introduction to CSS
    we apply css rules to things - some properties, to some things by a selector
    p { color: red; }
    selector(s) { property: value; }
    properties semicolon separated, selector comma separated
    comments /* */
    cascade
      which properties override which other properties?
      1. author styles & importance
        special override: put "!important" after a rule, it will win over all unimportant rules.
        but don't use this - instead, use specificity
        author styles override user-agent styles (browser defaults)
      2. specificity
        how specific is the rule, heuristic for how many elements it could match
          1000 if it's inline style (style="")
          100 for each id selector
          10 for each class selector
          1 for each element selector
      3. source order
        tie break. which one was defined last
    inheritance
      SOME properties are inherited by children, if it makes sense.
      font options are inherited, color options are inherited (you have to UNset them in the children if you don't want that)
      margin, border, padding not inherited. (you have to set them again in the children if you want that)
      can be customized.
- Box Model
    margin border padding
    top right bottom left
        shorthand properties
- Selectors
- Properties and Rules
- Typography and Coloring
    font-style (italic, etc)
    font-size
    font-family (sans-serif, serif, monospace)
    color: #00ff00, or web names (sets foreground color)
    background-color
- Position and Display
  position:
    static (the default)
    relative (does nothing by itself; defines meaning of top, right, bottom, left: relative to its normal position)
    absolute (move it out of the normal document flow, onto its own layer.
      span 100% of parent's width, and whatever height its children needs.
      top, right, bottom, left now mean, distance from the walls of the page --
        or, if it's inside some "relative" element -- distance from the walls of that element)
    fixed (fixed in the browser's viewport, regardless of scrolling.)
  display:
    block (like a block element)
      float property modifies block element flow - lets e.g. other text flow around it to the left or the right.
    inline (like an inline element)
    none (turn off display of the element, as though it weren't even there in the DOM.)
  visibility: hidden (invisible but still takes up space)



- Introduction to Foundation
- Responsive Web Design
- Semantic Web Content
- Web Accessibility
- Media Queries
    conditionally apply styles based on screen size or type. can check screen width, height, aspect ratio, portrait/landscape, etc.
    there is a "print" screen type for customizing the styles for printing a page
    more complex things like "does the user have a mouse that can hover other things? or just a touchscreen?"
- Team Oriented Environment"

DOM, document object model.
html and css text format is the serialized form
in browser memory, it is the DOM

selectors
    * - all
    tag - header, div span
    class - *.<classname> == .<classname>
        <tag>.<classname> ==
    id - #<idname>
        id is most efficient way to select a single element
    [attribute=value] - attr has value
    [attribute~=value] attr contains val in its val
        other similar attribute selectors
    combinators:
        div, div - one or the other, both
        div div - ancestor descendant
        div>div - parent child
        p+div immediate next sibling
        p~div any sibling

"#Region2 .latitude"

pseudo-classes
    elements that exist in some special state or another
<selector> : link
           : active (being clicked on)
           : visited (visited link)
           : focus (keyboard select with tab or click)
           : valid
           : invalid
           : blur
           : hover (moused over)
           : nth-child(aN+b)
           : first-child
           : last-child
           : nth-of-type(aN+b)
           : first-of-type
           : last-of-type
           : not()

pseudo-element
    elements that are in some special relation to other elements
<selector> :: before
<selector> :: selection
<selector> :: after {
    content: "html code" (inserted at end of the element's content)
}


div [first-of-type] [first-child]
    div [first-child]
    div
div
    p
    span
    p
p
div

external author CSS (link rel stylesheet href)
  the best way. can reference from multiple files
internal author CSS (style)
inline author CSS
  the worst way
user-agent CSS (browser) (we "undo" this with css resets)
user CSS (user options to browser for css, accessibility extensions, etc)

user agent
author
important
specificity
inline

use
zurb foundation OR
bootstrap

bootstrap
  css + js for reusable components to build responsive uis quickly.
  depends on jquery and popper.js.
  color classes: *-primary, *-secondary, *-success, etc.
  alerts - bar with feedback message for user
    class alert.
  buttons
    element button, class btn.
    many options
  dropdowns (structure:)
    inside class dropdown, class dropdown-toggle and class dropdown-menu
    inside the menu, classes dropdown-item
  forms & form controls
    surround label and input with class form-group
    class form-control on input
  navs - navigation menu
    inside class nav, classes nav-item; inside that, class nav-link
    class active for the current one
  navbars - fancier version of nav
    classes navbar and navbar-expand-* for some size e.g. -sm
    navbar-nav for the nav part
    supports collapsing
  modals
    display popup messages, to be closed by user action
    inside class modal, class modal-dialog; inside that, class modal-content
    inside the content, modal-header/-body/-footer
    data attributes to control the modal

css preprocessors
  css doesn't allow for DRY principle too much.
  preprocessors let you define variables for reuse, sets of declarations
    for reuse, and more.
  Sass is the most common, usually using extension .scss.
  Less is also used. similar feature set, somewhat different syntax.
  the browser cannot understand either of them; they are compiled into css server-side.

css reset
  a style sheet that zeroes-out the browser defaults to prevent inconsistencies
Normalize.css
  more recent alternative
  removes inconsistencies between browsers, but preserves some useful defaults

"adaptive"
write a css for every screen type
"responsive"
page reformats in response without reloading. harder to make

responsive features in html - srcset for images, different sources for different screen sizes
to prevent pre-loading the wrong image before CSS is even read
