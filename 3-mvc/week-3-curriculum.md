MVC crash course:
- model, view, controller
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers
- its overall lifecycle (including middleware, routing, filters, action methods, model binding, result execution)
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters
- Razor syntax (expressions, blocks, tag helpers, HTML helpers)
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers
- validation (client-side, server-side, ModelState, Data Annotations)
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation
- dependency injection
    - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection, the first half
- (anything about Razor Pages can pretty much be ignored)
