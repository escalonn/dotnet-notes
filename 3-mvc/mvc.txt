model view controller

request -> app server
    template (view)
    logic (controller)
    data (model)

before ASP.NET MVC we had ASP.NET Web Forms.
    e.g. File.aspx
        another kind of html with template
        too much in one file: devs, DBAs and others are all working on it.
        tightly coupled

MVC
    request -> controller (logic) -> model (db) -> view (design) -> ... -> response
    decoupled / separation of concern
    therefore testable because also all c# classes

action

controller depends on view and model
view depends on just model
model depends on nothing
    part of separation of concerns; testability

models should be strongly typed. that gives us the benefit of type checking and intellisense in the view.

razor syntax
    razor expressions - start with @ character. like @DateTime.Now
        it does its best to infer where the expression truly begins and ends.
        if that's not good enough, then you can be explicit and use @(DateTime.Now)
        whatever the expression returns, put that on the page as a string.
    these are HTML encoded automatically for us. e.g. any string containing <> will show up as &lt;&gt;.
    razor blocks - @ {  } runs logic or sets variables, doesn't by itself put things on the page.
        we have @if else if, @switch, @for, @foreach
    comments @* *@
    @model directive - what model will this view be strongly typed to?
    HTML helpers
    tag helpers
        the LINQ query syntax of MVC. for frontend barbarians to feel more comfortable.
        does many things html helpers can do, but not all of them.
        for some reason microsoft loves to mix them together.
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro#tag-helpers-compared-to-html-helpers

form tag helper
    includes anti-forgery token to prevent a malicious website from getting your browser to make requests to my website.
    makes every form submission i receive require it to send also a unique token that i put on that copy of the form when i made it.
label tag helper <label asp-for="Name">, the label for some value (html helper - labelfor)
input tag helper
    <input asp-for="Name" /> same as @Html.EditorFor(m => m.Name) or displayfor
validation tag helper - for client-side validation (and the results of server-side validation when form is rejected).
    <span asp-validation-for="">. html helper: Html.ValidationMessageFor
    leverages jquery to display validation error messages and prevent the form from being submitted.
validation summary tag and html helpers -
select tag helper and Html.DropDownListFor
    asp-for="Country" asp-items="Model.Countries"
    you give it the list of all, and also the property to put the currently selected one in.
    the list should be List<SelectListItem> property on the model.
    it's possible to get the items from an enum as well, can search how to do that.
a (anchor) tag helper (or Html.ActionLink)
    asp-controller, asp-action, asp-route-{name}
    link to a specific route / controller / action in your application
we don't need to say "Model." with asp-for, but we do for most of the other tag helpers.

still need server side validation because user could have javasript disabled or be malicious.
ultimately, client-side validation is more for user experience. faster error, don't need to submit the form to see it didn't work.

DataAnnotations
    required (non-nullable types are already required)
    emailaddress
    datatype
    range
    stringlength
    regularexpression

we can add our own validationattribute classes

any errors detected server-side during model binding show up in ModelState of the controller

routing
    convention (put in startup.cs)
        tried in order, fallback, so the default and most general one should go last
        we name them, so we can reference them with html helpers or tag helpers to generate links.
    or attribute routing (put in attributes on controllers and action methods)
        more precise control
        can use [controller], [action], [route]
        can have multiple routes that all work
    you can mix them

dependency injection using registered services
    adddbcontext (scoped)
    singleton
    scoped (request)
    transient (new one every class)

filters https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters?view=aspnetcore-2.0
    authorization filters - control access
    resource filters - implement caching
    (then model binding happens)
    action filters - run just before or just after the action method to manipulate inputs or result
        can do server-side validation here in just one place
    exception filters - handle exceptions thrown at any previous step
        alternative to error-handling middleware, which is put in startup.cs and is global
    result filter - just before & just after preparing the result to be sent and sending it
[HttpPost] attribute

model binding
    [bindnever]
    [fromquery]
    [fromroute]
    [frombody]
    [bind]

configuration in asp.net core
    pulled from configuration providers at runtime
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder adds several app configuration providers:
    - appsettings.json
    - appsettings.{Environment}.json
    - user secrets, when in Development environment
    - environment variables
    - command-line arguments
    later providers override earlier providers
    it's all customizable if you want to change or extend what CreateDefaultBuilder does
        you can get config from Azure Key Vault, Azure App Configuration,
        INI files, XML files, JSON files, in-memory collections, and others
    values show up in IConfiguration service, available from the Startup ctor
    rather than injecting IConfiguration into other classes, use the options pattern
        for a more encapsulated and strongly typed approach
        https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/configuration/options
    config read from JSON in nested objects (heirarchical)
        is flattened so that ":" (colon) represents nesting.
        "__" (double underscore) also works; colon isn't supported on some systems.

example for using hidden fields with collections nested inside a model:

<form asp-action="Post">
    @for (int i = 0; i < Model.Count; i++)
    {
        @Html.Hidden($"items[{i}].Id", Model[i].Id)
        @Html.Hidden($"items[{i}].Name", Model[i].Name)
    }
    <input type="submit" value="Post" class="btn btn-default" />
</form>

well actually in that case the model IS a collection
i don't remember why it has items[i] instead of just [i] which would work for sure
    maybe i was model binding to a parameter named `items`

MVC crash course:
- model, view, controller [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views] [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers]
- its overall lifecycle (including middleware, routing, filters, action methods, model binding, result execution) [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/controllers/filters]
- Razor syntax (expressions, blocks, tag helpers, HTML helpers) [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/razor, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers]
- validation (client-side, server-side, ModelState, Data Annotations) [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/models/validation]
- dependency injection [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection, the first half]
- (anything about Razor Pages can pretty much be ignored)

i recommend doing a mini-project using Entity Framework Core and ASP.NET Core MVC, with a database with one or two tables, and a UI with at least three or four views, which is not just a copy of the tutorial's. [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app]
