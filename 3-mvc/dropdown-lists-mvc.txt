a dropdown menu will be a select element having some name attribute, and each option in it will have some value attribute.
the form data will have (name)=(value) (the value of the selected option), and model binding will work on that name & value just like any other form control.
the main trouble is generating the correct HTML using the HTML helper (dropdownlistfor) or tag helper (select).
if you're using the tag helper, then asp-for will indicate the property that will wind up as the name attribute, and the asp-items will indicate the collection of value and text pairs that will be the options.
