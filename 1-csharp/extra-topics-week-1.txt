testing
    unit test
        check smallest unit of functionality
        should be isolated from runtime dependencies
        advantages: easy to diagnose failures
        can be written earlier in development, and thus guard against regressions
            across more of the product's lifetime
        easiest to automate
    integration test
        check how two or more components work together, up to the whole system
        usually slower to run
        use integration tests for typical scenarios rather than every
            possible permutation - unit testing is a more efficient way to cover
            unusual edge cases.
        we can write integration tests using all the same libraries as unit
            testing, e.g. xUnit
    acceptance test
        verify that aspects of the whole system's functionality meet
        functional or technical requirements
        might be manual or automated

TDD test-driven development
    write (failing) tests before code.
    only write enough code to pass the test.
    then refactor & cleanup the code.
    work in small steps.
