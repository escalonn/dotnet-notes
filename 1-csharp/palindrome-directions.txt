two projects, a library project and a unit test project.
library should have an interface representing a type which can check if a string is a palindrome.
library should have a class that implements that interface.
all the behavior of the class should be unit tested.
a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.
for example, these should be considered palindromes:
- "nurses run"
- "racecaR"
- "1221"
- "never odd, or even."
and these should not be considered palindromes:
- "one two one"
- "123abccba123"
