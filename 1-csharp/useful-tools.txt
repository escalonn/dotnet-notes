REPLs (good for early week 1):
    https://fuqua.io/CSharpRepl/
        more mature, just for csharp
    https://github.com/jonsequitur/dotnet-repl
        maybe cuter UI? supports F# and other languages

looking at CIL:
    https://github.com/pjbgf/dotnet-ildasm
        global tool for ildasm, input path to assembly, get CIL.
        ilasm can be downloaded awkwardly from nuget.org somewhere.
    https://sharplab.io/
        type C# on left, see CIL on right.
