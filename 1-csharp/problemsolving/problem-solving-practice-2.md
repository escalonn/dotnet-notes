1. Implement a utility method to print an array of int's
part 2: Implement a utility method which takes an array of a generic type and converts it to a string (without taking a parameter of Object[])
2. Implement a method which capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string
3. Implement a method which returns the value of n! when n is passed in as a parameter
4. Implement a method which reverses a String

5. Given an array of ints, return an array of ints which contains the maximum number in the array, as many times as it occurs
[2,3,5,1,5]->[5,5]

6. Given two Strings, return a boolean determining whether the second word is an anagram of the first
Implement a method which removes duplicates from an integer array using core java only (no collections or utility classes)
7. Implement a method which takes in a 3x3 2D array representing a tic tac toe board; have a boolean return based on if there was a winner
8. Given a string, find the longest sequence of contiguous characters and return the letter
'aaaabbbcccdcccee' -> 'a'

9. Separate an array into even numbers and odd numbers and give their count
[2,3,5,1,5] prints "1 even, 4 odd"

10. Given two arrays: [1, 2, 3] [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’] Combine them into one array (**note that these have different types…)
11. Write a program to count frequency of characters in an array
(['a','e','a','i'], 'a') -> 2

12. Draw a Logical Data Model of IMDb
13. Draw a Logical Data Model of software a university might use for students to register for classes
