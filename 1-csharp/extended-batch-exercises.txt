write a program and use git to keep track of it, uploading it to your personal code repo.
the program should: ask the user for some multi-word term, like "central processing unit", and print the acronym for that term (in this case, "CPU").
use multiple methods.
split the changes across multiple commits, at least two: right after you run dotnet new, and at the end once the program is done.

luhn formula

maybe transpose?

maybe to show interfaces, dependency inversion, and strategy design pattern -
    rock paper scissors

for events:
    game board where piece controls his own movement?
    manually-implemented logging? (static event?)

great example basis for TDD
https://github.com/solarwinds/ChessProject
has couple issues for associates to notice:
    board ctor off-by-one
    reversed NUnit AreEqual params (expected, actual)
