write a program and use git to keep track of it, uploading it to your personal code repo.
the program should: ask the user for some multi-word term, like "central processing unit", and print the acronym for that term (in this case, "CPU").

split the changes across multiple commits, at least two: right after you run dotnet new, and at the end once the program is done.
